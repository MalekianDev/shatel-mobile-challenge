## Challenge Overview:
You are required to build a web application that allows users to register, upload a large CSV file containing national IDs and corresponding email addresses, and send emails to all registered users using a dynamic email template. The application should also include a progress bar with pause, stop, and resume functionality to track the progress of the email sending task.
 
## Technical Requirements:
### Backend (Django):
- Implement user registration functionality with appropriate validation.
- Create a model to store user information, including national ID and email.
- Develop an API endpoint to handle file upload (CSV format) and extract data from it.

- Design an API endpoint to send emails to all emails using the dynamic email template.
- Ensure efficient performance by utilizing appropriate technologies or techniques.
 
### Frontend (React):
- Create a user-friendly interface for user registration and file upload.
- Display a progress bar to track the progress of the email sending task.
- Implement pause, stop, and resume functionality for the email sending task.
- Utilize appropriate technologies or libraries to enhance performance.
 
## Evaluation Criteria:
- Code structure and organization
- Proper usage of Django and React best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- User interface design and usability
- Error handling and validation
- Overall code quality and readability
##
- Please note that the implementation of the "send email" functionality is not required for this challenge.
- The recommended approach is to utilize React, although other JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, Angular, or even pure JavaScript are also acceptable options.
